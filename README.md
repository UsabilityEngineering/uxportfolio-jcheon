What's up ! My name is Jonathan Cheon. I'm interested in this class because I'm a Computer Science student who is interested in being close to a product team. I enjoy distinguishing small changes to websites, games, or products and seeing if it helps or makes the product worse. This class will help me understand design practices that will better make a product.
