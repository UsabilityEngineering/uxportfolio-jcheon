Robinhood
by Jonathan Cheon on 5/7/10 

Robinhood is one of my favorite and most important apps. Not only does it give me insight to today's market, but it also gives me the opportunity to trade equity wiht 0 commission. This app is so easy to use, beautiful, and minimal yet informative. Robinhood provides a lot of great UX/UI examples that apps should follow.

When I first enter into the app, I first notice its beautiful color scheme. The grey background, black cards, and green or red accent colors (depending on my stocks performance) make it such a **satisfying** app to use. This red accent colors immediately indicate to me that something is off or bad and it is true with the week's performance in the negative territory. It is so easy for me to recognize that my stocks were not performing well this week. This is such a **useful** way to immediately tell me information I want to know by using colors that I use in my everyday life.

I see a filled in box on the '1w' so that hints to me that that is the current selection that I'm on. When I click another option like '1m' I notice that the graph changed and the accent colors changed to green. This is a great example of **learnability** as the app reacted to my action.

I scroll down to see more in the app. My next section is the stocks that I own. This is very important because Robinhood decided to show the second most important thing that most users would want to see, their stock's performance. I agree and love seeing my individual stocks. Again, the same concept of green and red accents provide an indication of how the stocks is performing, whether they are negative or positive. This was taught to me at the begining of the app. The same concept is applied throughout the app which makes is such an easy way to **learn**.

I can scroll down more and see stocks in my watchlist. The same concept is applied.

When I'm all done scrolling through the homepage of the app, I want to look at other things I can do on the app. I see that there are noticible white icons on the bottom row. This makes is **efficient** when I'm moving throughout the app. I click on the magnifying glass where it takes me to the search page. What could I be searching? Well this is a financial app which means that I should be able to search for public companies. To non financial people, it is still friendly as it shows various options that you could search for before you even search indicated by the 'Top movers' and 'Popular collections'. If a ameteur trader is searching, they don't need to search as all. They just need to click on one of these options to see more information about the company. What a **useful** and **effective** way to allow users to browse stocks for all levels of traders.

The notification section of the app is really cool. They have displayed it in a way that its a texting app by having a circle picture of the company, name of the company, and a portion of the message. They again used something that all people using their app already know which is such an **effective** and **efficient** way for users to use.

Not only does it look like text messages, when you click on a message, you're able to interact with it like it is actually a text message. You can't really text your own message, but Robinhood provides possible actions that users would use by providing 2 options. Once you click on an option, it looks like the Robinhood app is "texting" and replied with your question. Super cool! 

In short, Robinhood uses knowledge that we already have to their advantage by displaying their app in ways that we are already familiar with. This is such a powerful way for apps to help new users, gain information, and navigate throughout the app without frustration. Robinhood deserved 100points in all portions of SEEMULES.
