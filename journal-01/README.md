Google Maps UI/UX Recent Update
by Jonathan Cheon on 2/18/2020

Google Maps turned 15 years old a week ago. This accomplishment comes with awesome features and UX/UI changes that overall help users navigate the menu better.

The first thing that I noticed is that the three horizontal bars (menu button) on the top left of the app is now gone! Where did it go?

I didn't know and the app knew that so the app had a little text box saying that things have moved. After this tip, I learned **(learnability)** that these few changes were made. Also, I would usually tap on that menu button to access my commute, saved places, contributions, and settings, but now its all on the bottom of the app. Very nice since I can access things with one less click **(Efficient)**.

In addition to these changed, the Google Maps icon changed. Instead of the square block, it's now Google's signature color with just the ping. Since design is a language, I can easily tell that this is a Google product with the color scheme and design. I can easily remember that they have changed from one icon to another.
